# Python Date Type
   # 1.Python | Sets
   Set is a data type in python used to store several items in a single variable. It is one of the four built-in data types (List, Dictionary, Tuple, and Set) having qualities and usage different from the other three. It is a collection that is written with curly brackets and is both unindexed and unordered.

   # 2.Python | Dictionary
   Dictionary. Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

   # 3.Python | Arrays
   Arrays are a fundamental data structure, and an important part of most programming languages. In Python, they are containers which are able to store more than one item at the same time. Specifically, they are an ordered collection of elements with every value being of the same data type.


# Python Variables
  # 1.Variables, expression, condition and function
   # Variables : 
A variable is a placeholder for information you want Python to recall later in the coding process when you need to complete an action. Technically, the variable acts as an address for where the data is stored in memory.
   # Expression :
Expressions are representations of value. They are different from statement in the fact that statements do something while expressions are representation of value.
  # Condition
Conditional statements are an essential part of programming in Python. They allow you to make decisions based on the values of variables or the result of comparisons.
  # Function
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. A function can return data as a result


# 2.Maximum possible value of an integer in python.
This value depends on the available memory, so it may change between different systems or configurations. The exact value of sys. maxsize is usually 2**31 – 1 on a 32-bit platform and 2**63 – 1 on a 64-bit platform.


# 3.Global and local variables in python
   # Global variable
A global variable in Python is often declared as the top of the program. In other words, variables that are declared outside of a function are known as global variables. 
   # Local variable
Local variables in python are those variables that are declared inside the function.


# 4.Packing and unpacking arguments in python
   # Packing  
 As its name suggests, it wraps all the arguments into a single variable, and this function call gets into a tuple called args. We can use any other name in place of args.
   # Unpacking
it is a special assignment operation. It allows  assign all members of an iterable object (such as list , set ) to multiple variables at once.


# 5.Type conversion in python
Type conversion in Python refers to the direct conversion of object of one data type to another data type. In this conversion, Python interpreter automatically performs conversion. 


# 6.Byte object Vs  string object
  # Byte object
A bytes object is an immutable sequence of bytes, conceptually similar to a string.
  # string object
Strings are objects in Python which means that there is a set of built-in functions that you can use to manipulate strings.


# 7.Print single and Multiple variable
   # Print single variable
In Python, print a variable is as simple as using the print() function.  For example ,  greeting is the variable, and we've stored the string "Hello, World!" in it. The print() function then displays whatever is stored in the variable.  
  # Multiple variable
Python also allows different values to be assigned to different variables in one statement. Values from a tuple object are unpacked to be assigned to multiple variables.


# 8.Swap variable
Swapping two variables refers to mutually exchanging the values of the variables. Generally, this is done with the data in memory. The simplest method to swap two variables is to use a third temporary variable.


# 9.Private variables name(A special variable) in python 
The __name__ variable (two underscores before and after) is a special Python variable. It gets its value depending on how we execute the containing script. Sometimes to write a script with functions that might be useful in other scripts as well. In Python, We can import that script as a module in another script.
